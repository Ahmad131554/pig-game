## Project Description

The **Pig Game** is a dice-rolling game for two players. Players take turns rolling a dice and adding up points. On each turn, the player can choose to "Hold" and keep the current points or "Roll" the dice again. However, if the dice shows a 1, they lose the points accumulated on that turn. The first player to reach a score of 100 wins the game. The game features an option to start a new game at any time.
